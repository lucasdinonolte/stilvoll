import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Stilvoll is an atomic CSS engine, thatâ€™s based around CSS custom properties to define tokens, generating typesafe utility CSS. It's un-opinionated and designed to be flexible. By default it does not generate any utility CSS classes. All utilities are opt-in via rules. Stilvoll comes with rules to pick up or let's you easily define your own rules to fit your project.

```js
// stilvoll.config.js
import { flexRules } from '@stilvoll/rules';

export default {
  input: ['./src/index.css'],
  rules: [
    // Pre-made rule
    ...flexRules,

    // Custom defined rules
    ['hidden', { display: 'none' }],
    ['visible', { visibility: 'visible' }],
  ]
}
```

This will add `hidden` and `visible` CSS utilities to your project. If configured to watch markup files it won't add them to your codebase until you're actually using them.

```html
<div class="hidden">I'm hidden</div>
```

When using the typesafe CSS you can import the `sv` object from `stilvoll` to access your utility classes.

```jsx
import { sv } from 'stilvoll';

function() {
  return (
    <div className={sv.hidden}>I'm hidden</div>
  );
}
```

Both will output the following CSS:

```css
.hidden { display: none; }
```
