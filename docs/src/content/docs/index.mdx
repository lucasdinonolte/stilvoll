  Stilvoll still is in early and exploratory development, so it's not really recommended for heavy-duty production use yet. Contributions, Issues and PRs are welcome!

Stilvoll is an undogmatic utility CSS engine, focussed on creating utility styles that actually fit your workflow. By default it's unopinionated, allowing you to configure the utility CSS styles you need for your project. Oh, and it's piggy-backing the typescript language server to provide autocomplete for all your utility classes in your code editor.
