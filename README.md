# Stilvoll

CLI and Vite Plugin to auto-generate atomic utility CSS from your CSS design tokens (custom properties).

## Features

- **css driven** no need to maintain your theme in a config file, you're css custom properties are the source of truth
- **on-demand** in build only the CSS classes youâ€™re actually using a generated
- **typesafe** optionally build a classname map to get autocomplete on the utility classes in your editor
- **extensible** create your own atomic css classes by creating rules on how to create them from your custom properties

## TL;DR

Turns this...

```css
:root {
  --color-blue: #0000ff;
}
```

...into something like this

```css
:root {
  --color-blue: #0000ff;
}

.color_Blue {
  color: var(--color-blue);
}

.background_Blue {
  background-color: var(--color-blue);
}
```

...and this

```jsx
import { u } from 'stilvoll';

// u is an autogenerated fully typed look up table of all 
// your utility classes to be used in JSX with near-zero 
// runtime overhead
<div className={u.color_Blue}>Cool</div>
```

stilvoll is a work in progress and should not be used for production purposes. Itâ€™s currently in heavy dogfooding mode, so expect breaking changes on below 1.0.0 versions. Feel free to explore and contribute to its development.
